## Assignment Description
This assignment examines the evidence for the "Sixth Mass Extinction" as first described by Barnosky et al. (2011). The paper can be found here: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09678. We are attempting to replicate a version of the graph produced by Ceballos et al. (2015): https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1400253 which graphs the cumulative extinctions of vertebrates by century.
