## Assignment Description
This assignment examines the evidence for the "Sixth Mass Extinction" as first described by Barnosky et al. (2011). The paper can be found here: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09678. We are attempting to replicate a version of the graph produced by Ceballos et al. (2015): https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1400253 which graphs the cumulative extinctions of vertebrates by century. 



## Special files

All team repositories will also include most of the special files found here:

### Common files

- `README.md` this file, a general overview of the repository in markdown format.  
- `.gitignore` Optional file, ignore common file types we don't want to accidentally commit to GitHub. Most projects should use this. 
- `<REPO-NAME>.Rproj` Optional, an R-Project file created by RStudio for it's own configuration.  Some people prefer to `.gitignore` this file.


### Infrastructure for Testing

- `DESCRIPTION` a metadata file for the repository, based on the R package standard. It's main purpose here is as a place to list any additional R packages/libraries needed for any of the `.Rmd` files to run.
